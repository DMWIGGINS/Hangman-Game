<!-- Prompt user to play

Computer to randomly select word to be guessed from word list. Words are set up as arrays with 1 letter per index.

User selects a key.


If letter has already been guessed then computer should take no action and wait for next guess

Player choooses letter and computer deducts 1 from "Guesses Remaining".

Computer compares letter choice to letters in word by comparing to indexes of the array. Use charAt?

If letter matches then computer reveals its position in the word. (how to make the letter show up in the correct slot?) 

If this is the final letter in the word the computer adds 1 to "Wins" and says "You Win!" and starts game over.

If not the final letter then computer waits for user to select again.

If letter doesn't match then computer adds it to the "Letters Already Guessed".


If this was the last guess then the computer displays "You Lose!" and starts the game again.

If this is not the last guess then the computer waits for user to select again. -->
